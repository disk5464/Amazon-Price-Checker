# Amazon-Price-Checker
This script gets the current prices of different energy drinks on Amazon and tells you their prices and if they are currently on sale or not

It uses SerpApi to scrape Amazon listings, then Streamlit to display the data on a webpage. 

Currently, the products are found using their Amazon ASIN codes. These are hard-coded in an array at the beginning of the script. Refer to "Just ASIN Codes" to see what each code maps to. 

Try out the Streamlit at https://amazon-price-checker-sbtu2uryamxbcwaadynwbe.streamlit.app/
