# Amazon-Price-Checker
This script gets the current prices of different Ghost energy drinks on Amazon and tells you their prices and if they are on sale or not.

It uses a basic Python web scraper to get the Amazon listings, then Streamlit to display the data on a webpage. 

The products are found using their Amazon ASIN codes. These are hard-coded in an array at the beginning of the script. Refer to the "current_ASINs" subfolder in the Notes folder to see what each code maps to. 

Try out the Streamlit at https://amazon-price-checker-sbtu2uryamxbcwaadynwbe.streamlit.app/
